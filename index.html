						<h1>JEFF KAMUTHU'S PORTFOLIO.<br />
						</h1>
						<p>I am a data story teller armed with a robust skill-set in data wrangling, transformation and extraction of business insights. I possess skills in Excel, SQL, Power Bi, Tableau, Streamlit, Python and statistics. I have done various projects including examining school distribution pattern in Kenya, and also done a project for unfolding the landscape of programmers in East Africa. My hands-on experience as a topnotch data-entry officer and sales operations lead, 
							have fine-tuned my practical skills. Having a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics, I am eager to channel my analytical prowess into making impactful and data-driven decisions. <br>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/food-prices-kenya/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">Food prices in Kenya.<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>This project aimed to analyze the evolution of commonly consumed food products in Kenya over time. 
										Employing Excel for data cleaning, the focus was on identifying prevalent commodities among local citizens. 
										Subsequently, Tableau was utilized to gain insights into the changing prices of these commodities. The combined use of Excel and Tableau facilitated a comprehensive examination of trends, 
										providing valuable perspectives on shifts in the consumption patterns of Kenyan citizens.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/programmers-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb" class="image fit"><img src="images/logos.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this engaging project which focused on the East Africa programming landscape, 
										the goal was to get insights on the distribution of different jobs based on roles such as Data analysts, Machine Learning Engineers and Software Developers. 
										The project also aimed to help job seekers by helping them understand the different skills required in the different fields. 
										The project also categorized different roles such as junior level, mid-level and senior levels and associated earning potentials. 
										The data set used was not large but had key details from different countries and using this data set, data manipulation and cleaning 
										was not an uphill task. I used Python based streamlit to make a visualization app.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Airbnb-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">Airbnb analysis using Python,Excel and Tableau.<br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Airbnb-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb" class="image fit"><img src="images/airbnb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In this project, I utilized a Kaggle dataset to analyze the performance of Airbnb listings in the USA. The primary goal was to gain insights into areas with 
										high income by assessing various factors such as geographical regions, house sizes, and types of units. By categorizing units based on size and evaluating their 
										performance, the project aimed to provide valuable guidance for individuals interested in joining Airbnb, helping them align their venture with specific regions
										 and budget considerations. The findings serve as a comprehensive guide for potential hosts, 
										offering strategic insights into maximizing performance and making informed decisions in the Airbnb market.

									<p>
										In this project, I used a Kaggle dataset to assess the operational efficiency of various Walmart stores. First,
										 I established a comprehensive database and seamlessly integrated the sales data into it. Employing feature engineering techniques, 
										 I unearthed valuable insights embedded within the dataset. Utilizing the power of SQL queries, I extracted meaningful information to gain a profound understanding of the performance dynamics. To enhance the communicative aspect, 
										I harnessed the capabilities of Tableau, crafting visually compelling representations that effectively conveyed diverse insights gleaned from the analysis.
