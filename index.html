									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Kenyan-school-analysis">School analysis in Kenya using Python<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the distribution of schools in Kenya, 
										with a particular focus on the role of their founders or sponsors, while distinguishing between public and private institutions. 
										This analysis encompasses all eight provinces in Kenya: Rift Valley, North Eastern, Coast, Western, Eastern, Nairobi, Central, and Nyanza. 
										Within the complex landscape of the education sector, various stakeholders play pivotal roles, with religious organizations taking the lead. 
										The distribution of schools across these provinces is not uniform, and it is influenced by factors such as the demand for education and geographical location. 
										It is worth noting that Kenya's population is predominantly composed of individuals between the ages of 0-18 years, 
										resulting in a substantial demand for Early Childhood Development (ECD), primary, and secondary education. 
										The quality of education is closely linked to the classification of the school as public or private. Typically, private schools are considered more prestigious, 
										thus their enrollment rates are lower compared to public schools.At the tertiary level, the education 
										landscape includes diverse options such as public and private universities, technical training institutes, technology institutes, and national polytechnics. 
										However, these higher learning institutions are relatively scarce due to the high costs associated with establishing and maintaining them, including the need to offer a 
										wide array of courses. As a result, the fees charged by these institutions are considerably high, discouraging many potential students from enrolling. 
										To counteract this, the Kenyan government has made efforts to increase enrollment by encouraging students to take loans through the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB).
										All visual representations of school distribution across provinces are conveniently accessible through a Streamlit application.<br>

										METHODOLOGY:<br>To conduct this analysis, I utilized a dataset provided by the Ministry of Education in Kenya.
										 The dataset underwent an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to prepare it for analysis. During this process, 
										 I addressed missing data by imputing null values with the mode, considering that the data primarily consisted of string values.
										 Duplicates were removed to create a dataset with unique values, enhancing data integrity. In the "Sponsor" column, 
										 sponsors with value counts less than 10 were dropped from the dataset as their contribution was deemed minimal, and their numbers were relatively high. 
										 Furthermore, feature extraction was employed to encode categorical columns as continuous variables, facilitating a more in-depth analysis of the data.To enhance the visualization of school distribution, I extracted the coordinates from the dataset to create a separate data frame. This allowed for easy iteration through the coordinates, simplifying the process of generating geojson plots illustrating the distribution of schools across the regions.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/programmers-analysis">Programming skills analysis in East Africa.<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/programmers-analysis" class="image fit"><img src="images/logos.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this intriguing project, I delved deep into the vibrant and evolving world of programming in the East African region.
										The primary objective? To unravel the intricate web of how professionals are distributed across various tech domains, including Data Analysis,Machine Learning,and Computer Science (software development).
										But that's not all. This project aimed to empower job seekers by offering a comprehensive insight into the diverse toolsets and skills required in their desired fields. 
										By understanding the skill landscape, individuals could align themselves with market demands and set themselves on the path to success.
										As the project unfolded, one thing became strikingly clear was the universal importance of programming's heavyweights such as Python and SQL. 
										These versatile tools stood out as foundational pillars, essential for aspiring tech professionals.The adventure didn't stop there.
										The project took a fascinating turn as it classified roles into the junior, mid-level, and senior categories, revealing the earning potential associated with each tier. 
										It was a journey through the salary landscapes of these roles, offering valuable insights for both professionals and employers.
										The impact of education levels also played a pivotal role in this exploration. It unveiled how different levels of education influence career trajectories, 
										illustrating the relationship between academic pursuits and job prospects.<br>
										METHODOLOGY.<br> The dataset i used was not large so performing ETL processes was not an uphill task.
										One intriguing challenge was to transform the categorical data of software tools into a format that could be harnessed for deeper analysis. 
										The solution was elegant: create binary columns, each denoting the presence or absence of a unique software tool among the individuals in the dataset.In this endeavor,
										 I traversed the 'software_tools' column, artfully splitting the tools and encoding them into distinct binary columns. 
										 Each binary column was a beacon, signaling whether a particular software tool was in the toolkit of individuals within the dataset.With this vital preprocessing complete, the path diverged into the realm of data exploration. I harnessed various grouping methods and visualization techniques to unravel the narrative hidden within the dataset. These visualizations not only provided insights into the distribution of skills but also hinted at the connections between software tools, roles, and other intriguing patterns that would shape the rest of the journey.</p>

									<p>MySQL project embodies the creation of a dynamic and cutting-edge central database management system tailored to revolutionize the operations of a car auto shop. 
										
										At its core, this system is designed to meticulously monitor and optimize three pivotal aspects: revenue, stock management, and the items sold across diverse sections of the auto shop. 
										The overarching goal is to seamlessly enhance the sales process, while concurrently providing invaluable data-driven insights into the product inventory.<br>

										Database Design:<br>In the foundational phase of this project, I meticulously crafted a robust relational database management system that caters to the precise needs of the shop's 
										stakeholders. The primary focus was on establishing crystal-clear relationships and foreign keys between the database tables, ensuring seamless data retrieval. 
										This meticulous groundwork was realized through the authorship of SQL scripts that generated the blueprint for the database schema.<br>
										
										Data Enrichment and Analysis:<br>With the schema in place, I embarked on the process of enriching the database with real-world data. This data was strategically loaded into the respective 
										tables to mirror the shop's operations and sales transactions. Subsequently, I harnessed the power of SQL queries to extract valuable insights. These queries were designed to uncover 
										purchase patterns across different price points and various sections of the auto shop, pinpointing trends and helping stakeholders make informed decisions.<br>
										
										Data Visualization and In-Depth Analysis:<br> To make these insights accessible and actionable, I established a seamless connection with MySQL Workbench. Here, I harnessed the available data to create stunning visualizations that offered a bird's eye view of product performance. The choice of filters was deliberate, as it facilitated detailed examination and in-depth insights into each product. Pivot tables played a pivotal role in summarizing and aggregating data, and I leveraged DAX formulas to construct new tables that calculated totals for different data columns, empowering the auto shop with comprehensive insights into its operations.In essence, this MySQL project isn't just about managing data; it's a dynamic tool that empowers the auto shop to enhance its operations, maximize revenue, and make data-driven decisions for a prosperous future.
