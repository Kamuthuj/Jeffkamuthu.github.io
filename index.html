						<h1>JEFF KAMUTHU'S PORTFOLIO.<br />
						</h1>
						<p>I am a data story-teller armed with a robust skill-set in data wrangling, transformation and extraction of business insights. 
						    I possess skills in Excel, SQL, Power Bi, Tableau, Streamlit, Python and statistics. I have done various projects including web-scrapping a YouTube API for data insights, 
							and also done one to assess price changes of key food commodities in Kenya. My hands-on experience as a topnotch data-entry officer and sales operations lead, have fine-tuned my practical skills. Having a Bachelors degree in Economics, 
						    I am eager to channel my analytical prowess into making impactful and data-driven decisions. <br>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/food-prices-kenya/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">Food prices in Kenya.<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>This project aimed to analyze the evolution of commonly consumed food products in Kenya over time. 
										Employing Excel for data cleaning, the focus was on identifying prevalent commodities among local citizens. 
										Subsequently, Tableau was utilized to gain insights into the changing prices of these commodities. The combined use of Excel and Tableau facilitated a comprehensive examination of trends, 
										providing valuable perspectives on shifts in the consumption patterns of Kenyan citizens.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Youtube-webscrapping" class="image fit"><img src="images/webscrap.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project where I was scraping data using a You Tube data API, from some of most common you tubers creating content on Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I created a YouTube API key which I 
										used as my credential to access the data. I used different sections of the documentation to access different data to build the project such as channel name, subscribers, total views and also videos posted per channel. 
										I loaded it to a Pandas data frame to do analysis. From the analysis I was able to see different videos from
										 different you tubers which would play a key part in assisting newbies on whose videos would help them understand concepts better. Visualization was done using Plotly.</p>

									<p>Insurance policies have been common nowadays with different companies offering different policies against different risks. In this project I focused on creating a machine model that
										 would aim to predict the amount of premium to be paid by individuals for a health policy. I utilized a kaggle data set which was relatively clean and performed different ETL processes and encoding of categorical variables. I later created a correlation matrix to measure the strength of the input features. I used the decision tree algorithm and also the random forest regression model to evaluate performance. I later performed the grid search to obtain appropriate parameters that would work relatively well with unseen data. 
										I retrained the model with the new parameters and gave me an accuracy of about 87% showing that the model worked well. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Airbnb-analysis" class="image fit"><img src="images/airbnb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In this project, I utilized a Kaggle dataset to analyze the performance of Airbnb listings in the USA. The primary goal was to gain insights into areas with 
										high income by assessing various factors such as geographical regions, house sizes, and types of units. By categorizing units based on size and evaluating their 
										performance, the project aimed to provide valuable guidance for individuals interested in joining Airbnb, helping them align their venture with specific regions
										 and budget considerations. The findings serve as a comprehensive guide for potential hosts, 
										offering strategic insights into maximizing performance and making informed decisions in the Airbnb market.

									<p>
										In this project, I used a Kaggle dataset to assess the operational efficiency of various Walmart stores. First,
										 I established a comprehensive database and seamlessly integrated the sales data into it. Employing feature engineering techniques, 
										 I unearthed valuable insights embedded within the dataset. Utilizing the power of SQL queries, I extracted meaningful information to gain a profound understanding of the performance dynamics. To enhance the communicative aspect, 
										I harnessed the capabilities of Tableau, crafting visually compelling representations that effectively conveyed diverse insights gleaned from the analysis.

									<p>
										In this project, I leveraged a dataset sourced from Yahoo Finance to analyze the performance of Uber stock prices. 
										Given that it posed a regression challenge, I employed decision tree regression to formulate the model. The data was appropriately partitioned into training and testing sets. Subsequently, I assessed the model's performance, and the results indicated its efficiency as a reliable model.

									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Tech-gender-gap" class="image main"><img src="images/gender.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In this project, my primary objective was to examine the distribution of various genders within the technology sector. Using Pandas, I created a data frame by employing Python to selectively extract the pertinent columns essential for the analysis. Python played a pivotal role in the data cleaning process, ensuring the dataset was refined and ready for analysis. To enhance the interpretability of the findings, I utilized the capabilities of both Plotly and Seaborn to generate compelling visualizations. This approach not only facilitated a comprehensive exploration
										 of the gender distribution but also enabled effective communication of insights through interactive pleasing charts.

									<a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Chicago-crime-analysis" class="image main"><img src="images/crime.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In this project, I merged different data sets from the year 2014 to 2016 to analyze crime occurrences in Chicago. Using Pandas, I was able to perform data cleaning where I dropped duplicated data and missing data. Using the clean data, the aim was to identify the most rampant criminal offences and what caused them and identify patterns with other crimes which resulted to the arrests. Also within the years I analyzed how crime rate changed and also tried to identify what caused the changes. 
										I used Pythons Matplotlib library to get insights on the crime rates.

									<p>
										 
                                        In this project, I utilized a dataset from Kaggle where I loaded it into a Pandas data frame. 
                                         Most of the data was in the right format and did not contain null values so the data cleaning was not as tedious. 
                                         I dropped columns that I did not require and did some feature extraction to get new columns 
										 that would be necessary for my analysis. After this processes, I saved this data in a new CSV file where I used Tableau to create interactive visualizations.
