						<h1>JEFF KAMUTHU'S PORTFOLIO.<br />
						</h1>
						<p>I am a data story teller armed with a robust skill-set in data wrangling, transformation and extraction of business insights. I possess skills in Excel, SQL, Power Bi, Tableau, Streamlit, Python and statistics. I have done various projects including examining school distribution pattern in Kenya, and also done a project for unfolding the landscape of programmers in East Africa. My hands-on experience as a topnotch data-entry officer and sales operations lead, 
							have fine-tuned my practical skills. Having a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics, I am eager to channel my analytical prowess into making impactful and data-driven decisions. <br>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kamuthuj/Kenyan-school-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">School analysis in Kenya using Python<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>The project does a comprehensive analysis of school distribution in Kenya based on the 8 Provinces, based on the founders/sponsors and the difference between public and private schools. 
										I used a data set from the Ministry of Education in Kenya. I performed ETL processes and dealt with missing data to enhance data integrity. Evidently, it emerged how different stakeholders have been pivotal in education particularly religious organizations who have played a key role. The study also explores the link between school classification, quality of education, enrollment rates and accessibility of schools. 
										Using Streamlit I was able to create interactive visualizations to show the distribution.</p>

									<p>In this engaging project which focused on the East Africa programming landscape, 
										the goal was to get insights on the distribution of different jobs based on roles such as Data analysts, Machine Learning Engineers and Software Developers. 
										The project also aimed to help job seekers by helping them understand the different skills required in the different fields. 
										The project also categorized different roles such as junior level, mid-level and senior levels and associated earning potentials. 
										The data set used was not large but had key details from different countries and using this data set, data manipulation and cleaning 
										was not an uphill task.</p>

									<p>
										In this project, I designed a central database management system for a car auto 
										shop which aimed to change operations by monitoring and optimizing revenue, stock management and sales 
										across the different products. I created a RDBMS which had clear relationships and foreign keys between tables. 
										Data was later loaded in the database and did different SQL queries to get data insights. Using Power Bi, 
										I created a dashboard and used a filter of the products to show different sales of goods across through different parts, and was able
										to unravel different purchasing patterns of the different products.
